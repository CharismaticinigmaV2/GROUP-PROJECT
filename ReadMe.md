GROUP 6 - CODE FOR  GENERATING FIXTURES FOR 10 TEAMS 

We were given a project to create fixtures for 10 teams that were provided to us by our lecturer and with some conditions to abide by so as giving us a challenge.

We started off with meeting the group members and setting standards on how our work should be carried out which created a momentum from the beginning of the project till the end
afterwards we decided to start with the flow chhart which would enable us to know the foundation of the code and how it would look like and how many parts we needed so as to understand step by step
what we have to do and that led us to facing many challenges and helped us compare with our code at the end of the day and realise our errors in the code and we tried our best but yeah here we are 

We met multiple times to learn the new libraries what they mean and how they will help our code to make sense, 
understanding and making functions before we even got to typing them down in clion, which we used to write the whole of our code step by step

The challenges set before us were getting time to frequently meet physically so we made a group on whatsapp which enabled us to communicate and identify errors that arose in our code and step by step we were able 
to build the code we have now which still doesnt give the desired output but its running which is the least we can say 

But the main issue we realised with our code is that theres a slight issue in our code where the legs are shuffled up completely as we put the shuffle command at the end of generation of the fixtures and it also 
messed around with the same city games at the end of each leg, we tried other solutions but they were laeding us to errors which we werentt able to solve due to the time constraints and other issues regarding 
the Github.

Which leads us to our other issue of github where none of us knew how to go about it the best way hence we had to go through videos and after a few commits of trial and error we managedd to commit the code 
into a file in the repo and present it for the lecturer.
